- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dsouzawilbur
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in generally coding. I have done my hands dirty in C, C#, Java, Python, NodeJS, PERL and a few more proprietary languages from IBM and Google
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all of the above. I try to solve hard coding problems or simply complex coding algorithms to reduce BigO.
